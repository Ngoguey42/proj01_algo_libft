# Project #1 LIBFT, Nov 2014
>>>>> #####Personal C Library

#####Grade ``(107/100)`` ``(107/116)*``
--------  -----------------------
<br>
As very few libC's and functions are allowed in school's projects,
this library regroups all kind <BR>of useful functions `prefixed by ft_`
that i will be reuse in my C (2014-2015) then C++ (2016) projects.
<br>

~50 specific functions were required for the project itelf, but i frequently update it with new functions.
<br>

### Content:
* Most `<string.h>` fuctions.
* A **'linked list'** set of functions. `ft_lst`
* A **'void* table'** handling set of functions. `ft_tab`
* A **'meta-table'** set of functions. `ft_metatab`
* A **'clock'** set of functions. `ft_clock`
* My `ft_printf` functions, with cool new flags and features. See More
* My `next_line` file-descriptor reading function. See More
* Tons of macro/structures for coordinates and colors handling.
* Some math functions.
