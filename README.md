# Project #1 LIBFT, Nov 2014
>>>>> #####Personal C Library

#####Grade ``(102/100)`` ``(102/108)*``
--------  -----------------------
<br>
As very few libC's and functions are allowed in school's projects,
this library regroups all kinds <BR>of useful functions `prefixed by ft`
that i will be reuse in my C projects.
<br>

~50 specific functions were required for the project itelf, but i frequently update it with new functions (~125 now).
<br>

### Content:
* Most `<ctype.h>` functions. (Summer 2014)
* Most `<string.h>` functions. (Summer 2014)
* `printf` function. (Fall 2014)
* `std::list like` functions. (Summer 2015)
* `std::vector like` functions. (Summer 2015)
* `std::map like` functions (implemented as an AVL). Also works as an `std::set`. (Summer 2015)
* `std::string like` functions. (Spring 2016)
* `std::string_view like` functions. (Spring 2016)

### Todo:
* `std::filesystem::path like` functions.
* `rolling hash` functions
* `std::unordered_map like` functions.
* `std::forward_list like` functions
* `std::deque like` functions
